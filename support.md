#h1 CG Futures Community Exhibition Support

The CG Futures Community Exhibition is a display of artworks brought in by attendees of CG Futures 2019. It is supported by an app available of both iOS and Android. In order for an artwork to be successfully augmented, it must first be submitted on our website at: http://cgfutures.com/join-our-community/

After submission, the artwork will go through a review process and be made available for scanning on the app. In order to use the app, you just need to hover the camera over one of these artworks and information about the artist should be displayed.

If you encounter any issues while using this app, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.
The most direct contact for app issues is Kkye Hall, who can be contacted at this address: kkyeh@outlook.com
